# RoomPriceGenie React Developer Coding Challenge

![RoomPriceGenie](team.webp)

## Overview

You have been asked to create a simple React application that allows users to browse a list of hotel rooms and add them to a cleaning table. A simple skeleton for the application was bootstrapped with Vite and should be built using React and TypeScript and should demonstrate your understanding of core React concepts such as hooks, context API, and reusable components. You can use additional libraries such as component libraries to build the application. The repository includes a small JSON file that contains the data that is required for this challenge. No backend service is required to store the data, all interactivity should take place in the UI. The coding challenge is designed so that it can be completed within 3 hours.

## Requirements

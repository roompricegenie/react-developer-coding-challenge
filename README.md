# RoomPriceGenie React Developer Coding Challenge

![RoomPriceGenie](team.webp)

## Overview

You have been asked to create a simple React application that allows users to browse a list of hotel rooms and add them to a cleaning table. A simple skeleton for the application was bootstrapped with Vite and should be built using React and TypeScript and should demonstrate your understanding of core React concepts such as hooks, context API, and reusable components. You can use additional libraries such as component libraries to build the application. The repository includes a small JSON file that contains the data that is required for this challenge. No backend service is required to store the data, all interactivity should take place in the UI. The coding challenge is designed so that it can be completed within 3 hours.

## Requirements

- The application should be built using React and TypeScript.
- The user should be able to view a list of hotel rooms, each with a number and category.
- The user should be able to click on a hotel room to view more details, such as its description and image.
- The user should be able to add and remove a room to a cleaning table by clicking the "Needs cleaning" button.
- The user should be able to view the cleaning, which should display all the hotel rooms they have added.
- The user's cleaning table should persist between page refreshes.
- The application should be responsive and display well on different screen sizes.

## Instructions

- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch to work on your changes.
- Implement the requirements outlined above.
- Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
- Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.
- In the pull request description, include instructions for running your application and any notes you have about your implementation.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Does the application meet the requirements outlined above?
- Is the application well-organized and easy to follow?
- Does the application demonstrate a good understanding of React concepts such as hooks, context API, and reusable components?
- Does the application display well on different screen sizes?
- Are the instructions for running the application clear and easy to follow?
- Bonus points:
  - Deploying the application to a free tier service for hosting
  - Unit tests using Vitest

Good luck!
